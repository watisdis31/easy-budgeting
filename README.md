## 🔐 Security (Important but Chill)

This app uses **Firebase Authentication** and **Firestore Security Rules**.

A few things to be very clear about:

- ✅ I **cannot** read or write other users’ data  
- ✅ You **cannot** read or write other users’ data  
- ❌ This app does **NOT** connect to your bank account  
- ❌ No credit cards, no spying, no funny business  

### About Firebase API Keys

Yes, Firebase API keys exist in the frontend.  
That’s **normal and safe**.

Security is enforced through:
- Firebase Authentication
- Firestore access rules
- Domain restrictions

So even if someone copies the key:
> They still get **nothing** 🎉

## 🧠 Why I Made This

Because budgeting apps are either:
- Too complicated  
- Too ugly  
- Or want my bank password (???)

So I made my own.

## 🏁 Final Notes

If this app helps you:
- Spend less (Yes, less spending on pokemon packs too)
- Save more  
- Or just feel slightly more responsible  

Then it has done its job.

⭐ Star the repo if you like it  
💬 Roast it if you don’t (politely)

*Easy budgeting. Less copium. More reality.*
